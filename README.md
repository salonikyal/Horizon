# Horizon
A mobile-platform AI-enabled learning application which creates a virtual PI and GD experience for the user using AIML libraries. It can be used by:<br>
1. Students/Freshers: To practice group discussions and interview for improving communication skills.<br>
2. Companies: As a tool to recruit students by including additional features like coding competition.<br>

PS: This is a project made by a group of 3 members. It is a partially implemented application as it was made during a hackathon competition organized by Facebook in less than 16 hours. The team won 3rd prize in the competition.
